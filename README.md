Sooooo....
I would like the following:
Have a Puppet-config that can easily maintain and set up a CI-server for any which project I'm at.

TODO:
- [ ] Puppet config with Jenkins. Learn Puppet along the way
- [ ] Vagrant up it with lets say Ubuntu
- [ ] Separate working-dirs and such. How?
- [ ] Sonar.
- [ ] Separate working dirs/db there also
- [ ] locus.io?
- [ ] Nexus? 

## Jenkins
- [ ] curl installed?
- [ ] hostname jenkins. Not ci.
