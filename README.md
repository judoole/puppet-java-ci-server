Sooooo....
I would like the following:
Have a Puppet-config that can easily maintain and set up a CI-server for any which project I'm at.

TODO:
1. Puppet config with Jenkins. Learn Puppet along the way
2. Vagrant up it with lets say Ubuntu
3. Separate working-dirs and such. How?
4. Sonar.
5. Separate working dirs/db there also
6. locus.io?
7. Nexus?
